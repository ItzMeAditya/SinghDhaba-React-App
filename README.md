# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `json-server`

json-server is a node module, and hence can be installed globally by typing the following at the command prompt:
"npm install json-server -g"

At any convenient location on your computer, create a new folder named json-server, and move to this folder.

Download the db.json file provided above to this folder.

Move to this folder in your terminal window, and type the following at the command prompt to start the server:
"json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000"
